This repository contains a simple Python demonstration script `t.py`.
The script simulates collecting publicly available information about a
phone number using several "drone" functions. It uses the `rich` library
to display a live updating dashboard of simulated findings.

To run the demonstration, install the dependencies and execute the script:

```bash
pip install rich
python t.py
```

The data shown is entirely fake and is intended purely for demonstration
purposes.
